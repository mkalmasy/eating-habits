   <p class="w3-opacity" face="PoynterGothicText" color="#a82689" align="right-justify">Since young adult eating habits set the stage for lifelong behaviors, it is crucial to understand how university students manage their healthy eating habits. Unfortunately, interviews and research studies have shown that students in colleges and universities struggle to maintain positive dieting behaviors, and actually show a general worsening of diet during this time. This is in short caused by many social, cultural, and environmental factors such as a newfound independence, friend groups, time between classes, availability and accessibility of certain foods, and personal taste preference. Healthy eating is not a priority for students either, as they focus instead on classes, extracurriculars, and jobs.

On NC State campus, these factors influencing student eating behavior are further identified. NC State Dining provides many on campus resources in order for students to eat healthy, such as the Dietician’s Dish, Wolf Approved food, nutrition counseling, and personalized meal plans. However, the majority of students are unaware that these resources exist, and the information is widely spread across an unorganized website. There is also a disconnect between students and the university in regards to meal accommodations. While NCSU maintains the statement that vegan and vegetarian options are always available in each dining hall, students believe that these options are limited to pizza or salad.</p>

   <p class="w3-opacity" face="PoynterGothicText" color="#a82689" align="right-justify">The majority of university students fail to obtain an adequate amount fruits, vegetables, and protein in their daily diets. They also tend to consume more fat, sodium, and sugar than is recommended.

This is largely due to the increased amount of freedom students experience when living on-campus at a univeristy. They no longer have meals scheduled for them, and have a wider variety of environmental factors influencing what they choose to eat.</p>

   <p><font face="PoynterGothicText" color="#a82689">What does your position entail?</font></p>
                 
<p class="w3-opacity" face="PoynterGothicText" color="#a82689">I am the Research and Development chef on campus and one of the registered dietitians. My primary role is to determine what meals are put into our production system, and determine the foods provided by our different dining options such as our dining halls, fine dining locations, and catering for campus events. We control everything from recipe ideation, to recipe entry into our production system, to labeling, to working with our outside vendors and their management teams. As a registered dietitian, I also work with my team to label everything, work with students with special dietary restrictions such as food allergies, medical reasons, preference, or religious reasons, etc.

<p><font face="PoynterGothicText" color="#a82689">How accessible do you think resources are to students, and how often do you think they use them?</font></p>

<p class="w3-opacity" face="PoynterGothicText" color="#a82689" align="right-justify">I find the website fairly accessible. I prefer to use the NC State Dining website, but I know some students prefer the On Campus app. When I go on the website, I can select each dining hall to see their specific menu, then select dining preferences to see foods that meet certain requirements, so it automatically hides anything that doesn’t meet my selected material. There are some things not listed on the daily menu, such as our salad bars. Students also have the ability to customize some meals depending on their dietary needs, but we are working on communicating that out.

<p class="w3-opacity" face="PoynterGothicText" color="#a82689" align="right-justify">We pride ourselves on having a pretty wide variety of menu items, but we could do a better job of communicating our menu items. We’ve found that depending on which locations students go to eat, there might not be the options they want, or, if they’re vegetarian for example, they might not like the vegetarian options we provide. We do have to make sure that we can support that in the kitchen with the staff and equipment we have while still serving top quality food to the hundreds of people that come a day. The more students ask us for a thing, the more likely it is for us to be able to provide it more often.

<p><font face="PoynterGothicText" color="#a82689">What resources do you provide that you think students should use more often?</font></p>

<p class="w3-opacity" face="PoynterGothicText" color="#a82689" align="right-justify">I think students should definitely use the website to get more information about our resources, and I really appreciate students reaching out to us through email or comment cards. It’s a great way for us to have that open dialogue, whether it’s talking to me or the kitchen staff. I also recommend students to follow us on social media so we can tell them about any new options or events we have. 

<p class="w3-opacity" face="PoynterGothicText" color="#a82689" align="right-justify">If students are unsure about what’s in the food they’re eating, they can go to the online menu, click on the food item, and it will display the full information about the ingredients, macronutrients, and a few key nutrients. This is available for every posted menu except for our fine dining locations, which have printed menus, and we work with our marketing team to update them any time we release a new menu.

<p><font face="PoynterGothicText" color="#a82689">What factors do you see influencing a student’s eating habits on campus?</font></p>
                 
<p class="w3-opacity" face="PoynterGothicText" color="#a82689" align="right-justify">Part of what determines what a student eats here on NC State campus specifically is where they are living. Students are most likely to go eat at places that are close to where they live, or where they are, so we try to provide something convenient to them. Second-year or further aren’t required to have a meal plan, so there is a chance of them finding food options elsewhere which can limit the impact we have on their dietary habits. The greater meal plan they have with us, the more likely they are able to take advantage of what we have to offer and the benefits we try to bring to the students, such as our counseling, our labeling, and some of the facility and menu designs we’ve done to encourage healthier choices.
